# App
The project is created using ReactJS, Typescript and Babel. 

Typescript is used to enforce typing in order to prevent errors while Babel is used for compiling the javascript from es5 and above to browser ready javascript. This makes compilation faster during development and type checking can be done before deploy. 

Eslint is also installed to provide linting and enforce clean code structure. This will also help to make sure that most type errors are seen during development and reduce type checking errors on deploy.

# Setup & Development
From the project folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Run `npm start` for a dev server. This should automatically open the browser to display the project.
